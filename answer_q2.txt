Q2: What happens if the center of the gaussian (in the space domain) will not be at the
(0,0) of the image? Why does it happen?
The further you go from the center of the guassian kernel's center, the lower the values wil get.
The F(0,0) is the zero frequency, which is the intersection of all pixels in the image. If F(0,0) will be affected by
a different value than the gaussian kernel's center, it will receive a lower value, and this will cause the picture
getting darker in the image space.
