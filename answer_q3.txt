Q3: What is the difference between the two results (Blurring in image space and blurring
in Fourier space)?

Blurring in image space with is convolting (IMAGE * KERNEL), meaning that each pixel's value is changed so that it gets
a weighted average of his (n^2)-1 neighbours.
Each of the m^2 pixels is convolved as many times as the kernel's size, n^2 times.
This process happens to pixels excluding the boundaries, as it is implementation dependent, and the output may vary
between different implementation.
That being said, it means that as bigger the kernel is, the more convolutions each pixel is convolved, as thus the
blurring is bigger.
On the contrary, while blurring in Fourier space, we make point-wise multiplication between the Fourier spectrum and
the zero-padded kernel. Fourier is non local, and thus, making point-wise multiplication with a kernel in any size
effects the whole picture in a uniform way. The bigger the kernel is, the further it gets from the origin, and the
frequencies of the image the kernel effects are higher.
