Q1: Why did you get two different magnitude images?
The convolution derivation is linear- on each pixel the same action is performed. On the contrary, the Fourier
derivation is exponential- we multiply each frequency by it's distance from the origin, and the further the pixel
(or, the frequency) is from the origin, the more significant the derivation will be, because we will multiply in
a greater constant.
This causes higher frequencies being outlined in the Fourier derivation, unlike the convolution one.
